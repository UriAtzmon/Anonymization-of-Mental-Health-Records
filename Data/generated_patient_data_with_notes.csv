Ms. Johnson reported feeling energized and engaging in increased goal-directed activities during these episodes, which led to financial strain due to impulsive spending. She also mentioned experiencing significant trauma during her childhood, but did not provide specific details.

Objective: During the interview, Ms. Johnson exhibited a rapid speech pattern and showed signs of distractibility, frequently shifting topics and struggling to maintain focus on the conversation. She appeared well-groomed and maintained good eye contact throughout the session. There were no obvious signs of psychosis or suicidal ideation. Ms. Johnson's mood was observed to be elevated, and she displayed an increased level of energy and restlessness. She also mentioned participating in risky behaviors such as reckless driving and engaging in casual sexual encounters during these episodes.

Assessment: Based on the patient's reported history and observed symptoms, Ms. Sarah Johnson meets the criteria for Bipolar I Disorder. The presence of a distinct period of abnormally elevated mood, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and risky behaviors suggests a manic episode. Ms. Johnson's disclosure of financial strain and social impairment due to her mood disturbances further supports this diagnosis.

Plan: A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and further assessment of Ms. Johnson's mood episodes and associated symptoms will be conducted to determine the appropriate treatment plan. Referrals for individual therapy, medication management, and psychoeducation on mood stabilization strategies will be recommended. Close monitoring of symptoms and regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to track progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

During the intake session with Jane Doe, it became evident that she has been experiencing a variety of symptoms consistent with schizophrenia. Jane reported auditory hallucinations, hearing voices that others do not hear, and experiencing delusions, believing that she is being monitored by the government. She also demonstrated disorganized speech, jumping from topic to topic without clear connections. Additionally, Jane displayed flat affect and showed poor insight into her condition, denying that her experiences were abnormal. These symptoms have been present continuously for at least a month and have persisted for over six months, resulting in social and occupational dysfunction. Furthermore, Jane's behavior exhibited signs of catatonia at times, with periods of immobility and lack of responsiveness to external stimuli. Despite the severity of her symptoms, there was no evidence of a mood disorder or substance use contributing to her presentation. Overall, Jane's narrative and observed symptoms suggest a diagnosis of schizophrenia, warranting further assessment and treatment.
