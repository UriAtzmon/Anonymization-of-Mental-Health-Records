    "### Project Background\n",
    "Mental health clinical notes often contain personally identifiable information (PII) and extended PII (ePII) such as places of work, family details, or personal events, which can compromise patient privacy. Traditional anonymization methods struggle to remove such details while preserving the clinical value of the text. This project aims to develop an LLM-based anonymization system that can identify and rephrase or remove ePII without losing medically relevant information. The system will be trained and validated on synthetic psychiatric records using a question-answering framework to assess both privacy protection and clinical utility."
